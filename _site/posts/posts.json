Some countries have been able to keep the situation under control, however, there are some that suffered more devastating effects from it. India and Indonesia are 2 countries in Asia that have the highest COVID related mortality and positive rates (Worldometers, n.d.) for COVID-19 cases, especially so in the main capital of the respective countries, likely due to certain underlying common factors within the countries.\r\nResearchers claims that Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, could have as many as 4.7 million people who are possibly infected by the virus in March 2021 (Sood, 2021). This is alarming as this number constitutes to “nearly half” of Jakarta’s population.\r\nProject Objective\r\nOur research would focus on identifying the factors that may have played a part in Jakarta’s high infection rate, how much each factor contributes to the rates itself and how much of the infection rate can be explained by these factors, before applying the same model onto other countries to verify our observations.\r\nDatasets\r\nIndonesia Monthly Covid Data\r\nDescription: The data contain COVID-19 measures at sub-district level.\r\nFile Format: Excel\r\nVariables: ID_KEL, Nama_provinsi, nama_kota, nama_kecamatan, nama_kelurahan, POSITIF, Meninggal\r\nSource: https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/\r\nIndonesia Population Density / Counts 2020\r\nDescription: The datasets contain population density / total number of people in Indonesia per grid-cell, at resolution of 30 arc (approximately 1km).\r\nFile Format: TIF\r\nSource: https://www.worldpop.org/\r\nIndonesia Birth 2015\r\nDescription: The data contain numbers of live births per grid square in Indonesia, at resolution of 30 arc (approximately 1km).\r\nFile Format: TIF\r\nSource: https://www.worldpop.org/\r\nBatas Desa Provinsi DKI Jakarta\r\nDescription: This is the geospatial data of DKI Jarkarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: OBJECT_ID, KODE_DESA, DESA, KODE, PROVINSI, KAB_KOTA, KECAMATAN. DESA_KELUR, JUMLAH_PEN\r\nSource: https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/\r\nJakarta Railway\r\nDescription: The data contain railways and stations in Jakarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: name, railway\r\nSource: https://data.humdata.org/\r\nJakarta Education\r\nDescription: The data contain kindergartens, schools, colleges, and universities in Jakarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: name, amenity, addrcity\r\nSource: https://data.humdata.org/\r\nJakarta Airport\r\nDescription: The data contain gates, helipads, and terminals in Jakarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: name, aeroway\r\nSource: https://data.humdata.org/\r\nJakarta Points of Interests\r\nDescription: The data contain amenities, shops, and tourist attractions in Jakarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: name, amenity, shop, tourism\r\nSource: https://data.humdata.org/\r\nJakarta Health Facilities\r\nDescription: The data contains healthcare facilities in Jakarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: Name, Address, Type, Class, District, Province, Lat, Long, Hospital\r\nSource: https://data.humdata.org/\r\nLiterature Review\r\nThe focus of our analysis will be on infection rates and we will draw similar methodology from the papers researching on death rates.\r\n1. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis on the death incidence by COVID-19 in São Paulo, Brazil\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/brazil.jpg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nTo gain an understanding of how socio-spatial behaviour causes COVID-19 transmission in the most impacted area in Brazil.\r\nMethodology\r\nSpearman correlation test\r\nAdjusted R2\r\nOrdinary least squares (OLS)\r\nSpatial error model (SEM)\r\nSpatial lag model (SLM)\r\nGeographically weighted regression (GWR)\r\nMultiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)\r\nLearning Point\r\nThe use of spearman correlation test to further see if the factors identified were relevant for the regression model\r\nThe results has shown that GWR model well represented the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in São Paulo, highlighting the spatial aspects of data among other spatial regression models\r\nAreas for Improvement\r\nA preliminary analysis could be conducted for the co-occurrence of global and local models to understand the spread of the COVID-19 better and also other infectious diseases in large cities first.\r\nThe use of MGWR could be considered for a more detailed analysis.\r\n2. Geographically varying relationships of COVID-19 mortality with different factors in India\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/india.jpg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nTo understand the relationship geographically for how different driving factors affect COVID-19 deaths.\r\nMethodology\r\nVariance Inflation Factor (VIF): to get rid of unnecessary redundancy in explanatory variables.\r\nOrdinary least squares (OLS)\r\nGeographically weighted regression (GWR)\r\nLearning Point\r\nThe use of local models helps to visualize geographically varying heterogeneous relationships between the dependent and the independent variables as it gives a more comprehensive understanding of relationships based on geographical contexts and study area’s known features.\r\nAreas for Improvement\r\nConsider the use of time evolution variables to further look at time series data for the dependent and independent variables to do more effective temporal modelling.\r\n3. The effect of sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 incidence of 342 cities in China: a geographically weighted regression model analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/china.jpg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nTo gain an understanding of how socio-demographic factors causes COVID-19 transmission in 342 cities in China in a geographic perspective.\r\nMethodology\r\nLocal geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model\r\nTraditional generalized linear models (GLM) Poisson regression model\r\nLearning Point\r\nThere are different ways to conduct GWR, which in this case was the use of the poisson regression model.\r\nAreas for Improvement\r\nCould look into confounding factors such as age, gender nationality for the multivariate analysis.\r\nMethodology\r\n1. Data Preparation \r\nData Sourcing\r\nData Importing\r\nData Wrangling\r\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\nStatistical Graphs\r\nHistogram\r\nBox Plot\r\n\r\nChoropleth Map\r\nKernel Density Estimation\r\n3. Geographically Weighted Regression Models (GWR)\r\nSpearman Correlation Coefficient\r\nSpearman Correlation Coefficient is used to determine the most relevant explanatory variables for the regression models\r\nCross-Validation score\r\nCross Validation Score is used to identify a window size to get different subsets of the data to be parsed into the model. (Mennis, 2006) (Farber & Antonio, 2007)\r\nAkaike Information Criteria (AIC) score\r\nAIC evaluates the model generated from the data and sees how well the model can fit other data. It also determines the best evaluated model that best fits data. (Mennis & Jeremy, 2006)\r\nStoryboard\r\n1.
