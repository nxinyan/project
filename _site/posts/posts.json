Some countries have been able to keep the situation under control, however, there are some that suffered more devastating effects from it. India and Indonesia are 2 countries in Asia that have the highest COVID related mortality and positive rates (worldometers, n.d.) for COVID-19 cases, especially so in the main capital of the respective countries, likely due to certain underlying common factors within the countries.\r\nResearchers claims that Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, could have as many as 4.7 million people who are possibly infected by the virus in March 2021 (Sood, 2021). This is alarming as this number constitutes to “nearly half” of Jakarta’s population.\r\nThus, our research would focus on identifying the factors that may have played a part in Jakarta’s high infection rate, how much each factor contributes to the rates itself and how much of the infection rate can be explained by these factors, before applying the same model onto other countries to verify our observations.\r\nReferences\r\nSood, A.
